 For a fun run-type event, both setups require volunteers to track laps, hand out water, and cheer on runners. After the running is over, you'll need to collect pledges, calculate final tallies for students, classes, and grades, and recognize students for their hard work. Rondo School of Discovery successfully raised a lot of money for their school by pledges! :D</p>

All parents of elementary students in the Eastvale area schools are welcome!  We received overwhelmingly positive feedback from our events last Fall, so we are excited to offer 3 MORE NIGHTS of Eastvale Parents on Point over the next few months.  The first night is on March 11th at 6pm.  See the attached flyer for more information. ClickHERE for a short video about the event.Parents have the duty to protect their children's rights until they are old enough to make their own way in the world. The authority to make decisions concerning and affecting the care, welfare and proper development of the child is known as 'parental responsibility'. The sociological definition of parents. is fluid, especially when the law does not set the rules. The sociological definition of fertility focuses on. the number of children born in a society or among a particular group. The term parent-child relationship refers to the unique and enduring bond between a caregiver and his or her child. To understand the parent-child relationship, we must look at the ways that parents and children interact with one another physically, emotionally, and socially. Think about your parents.Overprotective parents seek to shelter their children from physical, mental, or emotional pain. They want to ensure that their kids are successful, so they might cushion the path or soften the blows of everyday life.The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines “helicopter parent” as a parent who is overly involved in the life of his or her child. ... The typical smother mother feels the need to control or be involved in every aspect of her child's life and wants to know what her child is doing at all times.

Our current reality is that we will open with remote learning for those tracks for the month of July. As it stands today (and I say that because it changes often) we will be open for students to attend physically on campus starting on August 3rd with the return of B-track.Here a few of the things we have been working on and will continue to give attention in the coming weeks.
We are preparing a virtual Parent Information Night which parents will be able to access on the Rondo Raptor YouTube channel. The play list for the Parent Information Night will be unlisted so an email with the link will be sent out when it is live. You have an opportunity to see the school, here about the STEAM instructional framework, meet the PTA and then go to other videos produced by each grade level to go over expectations.
Staff is working on current procedures for keeping the campus clean and disinfected and awaits news from the county office of health for changes in suggestions so that we can ensure a safe learning environment for students and staff.</p>
